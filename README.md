The used car market in India was valued at USD 24.24 billion in 2019, and it is expected to grow by CAGR of 15.12% during the upcomign years (2020-2025). The used car market has drastically evolved in the country, with the growth of the organized and semi-organized sector.The second-hand car or used car market crossed the 4 million units mark in FY 2018, which states that the used car market is 1.3 times of the new car market. One of the key growth drivers of the market is the revision of the GST rate on used cars from 28% to 12-18%.

As Automotive industry in India has already entered the BS-VI era from April 2020, the value proposition of used cars is expected to increase, as new cars are expected to become expensive due to additional technology costs.
